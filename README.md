# Databricks-Intro-Project
Figuring out how to use Azure Databricks  

Steps to creating Workspace:  
1. From Azure Databricks create a databricks workspace with the details your project requires.  
2. Once the workspace is created launch the workspace, you should now see the Databricks environment.  
3. We then need to create the appropriate cluster for our task. A cluster, in the context of Databricks, is a group of virtual machines that work together to process and analyze data.
